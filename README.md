## Implementation
Roc IsoDate is a Roc package which which can convert an ISO date/time string into the [Utc][utc_link] type provided by the Basic CLI and Basic Webserver platforms, which stores the nanoseconds since the UNIX epoch date. When parsing time-only strings, the package returns a [UtcTime][utctime_link], which is similar to the `Utc` type, but stores the nanoseconds since midnight.

Note that due to the expense of purchasing the ISO 8601-2:2019 standard document, my implementation is based on a [2016 pre-release][iso_8601_doc] copy of the 8601-1 standard, so my implementation may not fully conform to the latest revision to the standard.

## Progress
- Full support for parsing all date representations.
- Full support for parseing local time representations.
- Full support for offset from UTC time representations.
- Full support for combined date/time representations.
- Can Parse from `Str` or from a `List U8` of Utf-8 bytes.

## Future Plans
- Add support for parsing to both Utc and DateTime.
  - With this comes a slew of features: Times, Dates, DateTimes, and Durations.
  - Functionality to convert between the above DateTime types, and Utc types.
  - __This means the Library is expanding to be more of a universal DateTime library, and not just for ISO parsing!__ üöÄ
- Time interval representations will be added once the parsing to Date/Time/DateTime is complete.
- Once Parsing is complete, add formatting dates and times to ISO strings.
- Research adding custom encoding/decoding for json parsers.

## Planned API
To simplify the API, the plan is to reduce the package exports to the various date and time types. Thus, the library will simply provide a collection of types for working with dates. Each of these types will provide all the necessary functions for interacting with it, including functions for converting to and from ISO strings, and converting to and from Utc types.

Thus, an application might look like the following:
```roc
App "MyDateApp"
    packages {
        pf: "https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli/releases/download/0.9.0/oKWkaruh2zXxin_xfsYsCJobH1tO8_JvNkFzDwwzNUQ.tar.br"
        dt: "https://github.com/imclerran/Roc-IsoDate/releases/download/v0.2.2/xltugTSJABqhNB-sqjutGTJOkBMqHy2uHLr-fri4FGo.tar.br"
    }
    imports [
        dt.DateTime,
        pf.Utc,
        pf.Stdout,
        pf.Task,
    ]
    provides [main] to pf

main =
    utcNow <- Task.await Utc.now
    dtNow = DateTime.fromUtc utcNow # Convert Utc to DateTime easily
    dtEpoch = DateTime.unixEpoch # Constructor for the epoch
    dtSomeTime = DateTime.fromIsoStr "2024-04-19T11:31:41.329515-05:00" # parse a DateTime from ISO str easily
    utcSomeTime = DateTime.toUtc dtSomeTime # DateTime can be parsed to utc easily
    nanosSomeTime = Utc.toNanosSinceEpoch utcSomeTime
    
    Stdout.line "ISO epoch: $(DateTime.toIsoStr dtEpoch)" |> Task.await
    Stdout.line "Time now: $(Num.toStr dtNow.time.hour):$(Num.toStr dtNow.time.minute):$(Num.toStr dtNow.time.second)" |> Task.await
    Stdout.line "Month some time: $(Num.toStr dtSomeTime.date.month)" |> Task.await
    Stdout.line "Utc nanos some time: $(Num.toStr nanosSomeTime)" |> Task.await
```

This is just a small sample of the available functionality, but meant to demonstrate the general design of the API. Moving to and from computer-friendly representations like `Utc`, web-friendly representations like ISO `Str`s, and human friendly representations like `DateTime` are all just a single function call away.  `Durations` and `TimeInterval`s will add additional quality of life functionality for easily manipulating dates and times.

## Known Issues
- Missing features mentioned above.
- ISO Requirement for combined date-time strings to have only non-reduced accuracy dates is not enforced
- ISO Requirement for combined date-time strings to be in completely basic or completely extended format are not enforced.
