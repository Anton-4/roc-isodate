Roc-IsoDate is a universal date and time package for Roc. It Features several useful types for working with dates and times. Its primary types (`Date`/`Time`/`DateTime`) store dates and times in a human friendly manner, but allow easy conversion to and from computer friendly types like (`Utc`/`UtcTime`) as well as web web friendly ISO 8601 strings. Roc IsoDate is intended to be a one-stop-shop for all things date and time. üìÜ ‚è∞ üì¶

## Implementation
Roc IsoDate is a Roc package which which can convert an ISO date/time string into the [Utc][utc_link] type provided by the Basic CLI and Basic Webserver platforms, which stores the nanoseconds since the UNIX epoch date. When parsing time-only strings, the package returns a [UtcTime][utctime_link], which is similar to the `Utc` type, but stores the nanoseconds since midnight.

Note that due to the expense of purchasing the ISO 8601-2:2019 standard document, my implementation is based on a [2016 pre-release][iso_8601_doc] copy of the 8601-1 standard, so my implementation may not fully conform to the latest revision to the standard.

## Progress
- Full support for parsing all date representations.
- Full support for parseing local time representations.
- Full support for offset from UTC time representations.
- Full support for combined date/time representations.
- Can Parse from `Str` or from a `List U8` of Utf-8 bytes.
- Unify API around `Date`/`Time`/`DateTime` types
  - This means converting to and from ISO strings is as simple as:
  - `DateTime.fromIsoStr str` or `Time.toIsoStr date`
  - Similarly, converting to and from `Utc` is easy:
  - `Date.toUtc date` or `DateTime.fromUtc utc`

## Future Plans
- Time interval representations will be added once the parsing to Date/Time/DateTime is complete [DONE üöÄ].
- Once Parsing is complete, add formatting dates and times to ISO strings.
- Research adding custom encoding/decoding for json parsers.

## Unified API
To extend functionality and simplify the API, library *now* simply provides a collection of types for working with dates. Each of these types provide all the necessary functions for interacting with it, including functions for converting to and from ISO strings, and converting to and from Utc types, as well as various other constructors and math functions.

Thus, an application might look like the following:
```roc
App "MyDateApp"
    packages {
        pf: "https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli/releases/download/0.9.0/oKWkaruh2zXxin_xfsYsCJobH1tO8_JvNkFzDwwzNUQ.tar.br"
        dt: "https://github.com/imclerran/Roc-IsoDate/releases/download/v0.2.2/xltugTSJABqhNB-sqjutGTJOkBMqHy2uHLr-fri4FGo.tar.br"
    }
    imports [
        dt.DateTime,
        dt.Duration,
        pf.Utc,
        pf.Stdout,
        pf.Task,
    ]
    provides [main] to pf

main =
    utcNow <- Task.await Utc.now
    dtNow = DateTime.fromUtc utcNow # Convert Utc to DateTime easily
    dtEpoch = DateTime.unixEpoch # Constructor for the epoch
    dtSomeTime = DateTime.fromIsoStr "2024-04-19T11:31:41.329515-05:00" # parse a DateTime from ISO str easily
    dtLaterDate = dtSometime |> DateTime.addDateTimeAndDuration (Duration.fromHours 25)
    utcLaterDate = DateTime.toUtc dtSomeTime # DateTime can be parsed to utc easily
    nanosLaterDate = Utc.toNanosSinceEpoch utcLaterDate
    
    Stdout.line "ISO epoch: $(DateTime.toIsoStr dtEpoch)" |> Task.await
    Stdout.line "Time now: $(Num.toStr dtNow.time.hour):$(Num.toStr dtNow.time.minute):$(Num.toStr dtNow.time.second)" |> Task.await
    Stdout.line "Day some time: $(Num.toStr dtSomeTime.date.day)" |> Task.await
    Stdout.line "Utc nanos later date: $(Num.toStr nanosSomeTime)" |> Task.await
```

This is just a small sample of the available functionality, but meant to demonstrate the general design of the API. Moving to and from computer-friendly representations like `Utc`, web-friendly representations like ISO `Str`s, and human friendly representations like `DateTime` are all just a single function call away. `Durations` and `TimeInterval`s also add quality of life functionality for easily manipulating dates and times.

## Known Issues
- Missing features mentioned above.
- ISO Requirement for combined date-time strings to have only non-reduced accuracy dates is not enforced
- ISO Requirement for combined date-time strings to be in completely basic or completely extended format are not enforced.
